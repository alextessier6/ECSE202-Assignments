//The append function concatenates the inputted elements (the "in" string) to a "out" string.

    int j=0;
    while (in[j] != '\0'){ //Concatenates the elements until the end of the "in" string, identified by the null character

//The toString function, with the help of the append function, concatenates the inputted argvs into a single string containaing the individual characters. It creates a buffer containing the characters of the inputted arguments, without any white spaces.

    int i=1; //The name of the program, included in argv[0], is to be ommited

        append (buffer,argv[i]);
        i++;
